## List of Most Popular TV series

A third year mobile programming project in Android Studio. This app mainly displays the list of the most popular Tv series obtained from an API so the classification isn't done by me! :wink:

## Prerequisites 
- Android Studio Installation
- Creation of a github account if non existent

https://imdb-api.com/en/API/MostPopularTVs/k_8rZ9Ie4z

Respected Instructions
- Screen with a list of elements.
- Screen with the details of a list's element.
- An Web service call to an API Rest.
- Data storage in cache.
- Clean Architecture and MVC pattern.
- Use of controllers.
- Clean Gitflow.

**NB:** This project was started a lot earlier than the addition date of the fist push. This is due to the fact that, I had a lot of issues and started the project a second time with this name. However, The original project beared the name Recyclerview.


## Functionalities:

The activity concerned by this homepage has not been added to the android xml file as it causes the app to crash. The above picture is that of the homepage xml file.
